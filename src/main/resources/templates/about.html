    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px">
        BeerTag enables your users to manage all the beers that they have drunk and want to drink.
        Each beer has detailed information about it from the ABV (alcohol by volume) to the style and who created it.
        Data is community driven, and every beer lover can add new beers or update his old ones.
        Of course, there are different users with all the information about them -
        first and last name, username, email and password. You can see this user info and your own wishlist.
        There are also admins with some special abilities such as deleting / editing users and beers
